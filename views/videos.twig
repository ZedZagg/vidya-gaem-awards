            <h2>This year, we don't have a video asking people to donate the skits.</h2>
            <p>Instead, we're focusing on the awards themselves, as well as related video game content.</p>
            <p>Our standards are still pretty low, but we want less <em>"lel so randum XD" *holds up spork*</em> and more interesting and relevant videos related to video games and/or the video game industry in 2013. Just like "gaming journalists!"</p>
            <p>If you have something you think fits the bill, go ahead and submit it! It doesn't have to be super serious, just quality vidya content.</p>
            <p>We have about a million voice actors on standby, so if you have a good idea but think your voice is shit, email us and we'll help you out.</p>

            <h2 style="margin-top: 30px;">Examples of quality content:</h2>
            <ul>
            <li>Talking about [game publisher] took a massive shit on [your favorite franchise]</li>
            <li>Showcasing a game you thought was excellent but didn't get nominated for anything (because /v/ has shit taste)</li>
            </ul>

            <h2 style="margin-top: 30px;">When / where do I submit?</h2>
            <p>Send us an email at <a href="mailto:videos@vidyagaemawards.com">videos@vidyagaemawards.com</a>.
            You can either attach the video to the email, or upload it somewhere like <a href="https://mediafire.com">MediaFire</a>
            or as an unlisted video on <a href="https://youtube.com">YouTube</a>.</p>
            <p>We're accepting videos for as long as possible, so you've got at least until the end of January.</p>

            <h3 style="margin-top: 0px;">Requirements:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Your video must be related to video games in some way.</li>
                <li>There is no length restriction this year, but videos longer than a minute or two will need to be excellent to be included.</li>
                <li>We're looking for original content, not videos that already have 10k views on YouTube.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Recommendations:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>1080p is best, but we will accept any resolution down to 320p. Give us the highest you can.</li>
                <li>Video game or video game related analysis is just what we're looking for.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>What's in it for me?</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>We'll put your name and link to your YouTube channel in the credits if you want.</li>
                <li>But really, there's nothing in it for you, apart from the smug satisfaction of being in the video.</li>
