			<p>The /v/GAs (<em>Vidya Gaem Awards</em>) were born in early December 2011 as a response to the Spike VGAs, which were worse than anybody could have predicted and an insult to the entire gaming industry.</p>
			<p>A small group of anon decided that instead of just bitching, they could do something about it. The result: an award show with no budget, no skill and no hope that it would get anywhere. Created and run based entirely on the feedback of /v/, the /v/GAs are a way to recognise both the best and the worst that the gaming industry has to offer, and to have a bit of fun while doing so.</p>

				<p>The /v/GAs are run for /v/, by /v/. It couldn't be done without the help of countless anon in figuring out categories, nominations and finally voting for the winners.</p>
				<p>We're always happy for people to get involved: this is meant to be a collaborative effort, not just run by a few people. If you'd like to help, check out the <a href="/forum-archive">forum</a> or the <a href="http://steamcommunity.com/groups/vidyagaemawards">Steam group</a>.</p>
